**[Preview](https://streamable.com/r0tbjw)**

Just a simple yet fun script to enable a bounce mode on vehicles similar to the Mercedes bounce setting. 

Can toggle if only players vehicle should bounce or if vehicles in range. 

Can specify vehicle types to allow bounce mode if you like, default all types are active.

To remain standalone this works with a simple RegisterCommand, this could be easily adapted to work with a item setup however I will not be doing this.
